# OMG Systems Modeling Language™ (SysML®) v2 Release

The [SysML v2 Release](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling/SysML-v2-Release) repository contains the latest incremental release of the SysML v2 specification documents, 
example models and model library. It also provides instructions for user installation of SysML v2 Pilot Implementation editors. For developer installs, please see the
development repositories also available from the [Systems Modeling](https://github.com/Systems-Modeling) organization on GitHub.

## Team

This implementation is maintained by the Reference Implementation Working Group of the [OMG® Systems Modeling Community (SMC)](https://www.omg.org/communities/systems-modeling-community.htm). 
The SMC is a community for systems modeling end users, tool vendors and academia to share practices that promote the adoption and advancement of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). 
It's purpose is to:
* Provide a forum for systems modeling end users, tool vendors and academia to share practices that promote the adoption and advancement of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE).
* Act as a bridge to the OMG Standard Development Organization (SDO) process, providing validated inputs to the SDO to update relevant specifications based on evolving user needs, including the Kernel Modeling Language (KerML), the OMG Systems Modeling Language™ (SysML®) and Systems Modeling API & Services.
* Provide support for building other modeling languages and domain-specific extensions based on KerML and/or SysML.

## Specifications

In June 2023, the OMG adopted the following three _beta specifications_ for KerML, SysML v2 and the Systems Modeling API, which then entered the OMG _finalization_ process. Since then, the SMC Reference Implementation Working Group has continued to publish incremental releases of the pilot implementation, in support of the work of the three finalization task forces.

In April 2024, OMG released updated _beta 2 specifications_, which are currently available from OMG:

* [Kernel Modeling Language (KerML), version 1.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/KerML/1.0/Beta2)
* [OMG Systems Modeling Language (SysML), version 2.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/SysML/2.0/Beta2)
* [Systems Modeling Application Programming Interface (API) and Services, version 1.0](https://www.omg.org/spec/SystemsModelingAPI/1.0/Beta2)

After another round of finalization, it is expected that the corresponding _formal specifications_ will be published in 2025.
